This folder contains some basic programming exercises which I've completed from multiple sources.

Below is a description of what each of the programs do

- PrimeNumber.py : This program determines whether an inputted integer is a prime number or not

- Palindrome.py : This program determines whether an inputted string is a palindrome or not.

- CountOccurences.py : This program returns the number of characters, words, lines & vowels from a text file. It is a very 
simple program that is meant to work for text files containing strings only. 

- Binary.py : This is a simple program that converts user-inputted binary numbers into decimal numbers

- holiday.py : This program calculates the cost of going on a holidy based on the cost of accommodation & transport.

- Calculator.py : This simple program serves as a simple calculator for the user. The user can input two numbers and 
choose an operation from addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

- factorial.java : This program calculates the factorial of a user-inputted number

- rockPaperScissors.java : this program implements a simple game of Rock, Paper & Scissors

- NoDups.java : this is a simple program that creates a function which accepts an integer array argument and removes all
duplicates from that array

- answers.java : this is a simple program that implements a quick mathematical test for the user to complete by
providing the user with a set of subtraction questions from randomly generated numbers, accepting
the user's answer and reporting whether the answer was correct or wrong. The test also keeps an 
execution log of all the questions and answers, and at the end provides the amount of time taken
to complete the test.

- HexToDecimalConversion.java : this program implements a simple program to convert a hex string to a decimal number

- UpdateTest.java : this program executes a simple SQL Update query

- InsertTest.java : this program executes a simple SQL insert and SQL delete query

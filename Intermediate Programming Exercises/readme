This folder contains some programming exercises completed by me from various sources.

Below is a description of what each of the programs do

  - Course.java : this program implements a class 'Course' class, that defines a course at university, and then 
    implements the Java Comparator interface to provide new Comparator Classes that will be used to 
    compare the courses using two different criteria. Finally, the program then compares some courses
    and using the Java Collections Framework, executes certain operations on the Course instances.

  - QuickSort.java : this program is a simple implementation of the QuickSort algorithm
  
  - linearRegression.py : This program executes a simple linear regression algorithm on the diabetes datasets from
    the sklearn module. The program defines a custom linear regression function that returns the slope and intercept of
    the regression line of best fit, and then implements it on the required training dataset. The resultant 
    line is then tested on the test data set. 
    
  - kmeans.py : this program is a simple implementation of the K-Means Clustering Algorithm

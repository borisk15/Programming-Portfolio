This project consisted of creating a database of books available at a Bookstore using MySQL, and building a java program that
allows the bookstore clerk (or any other user) to perform certain actions on the database, including: 
  - entering new books into the database
  - update book information
  - delete books from the database
  - search a database to find a specific book
